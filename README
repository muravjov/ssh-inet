 ssh-inet
 
 Use it like ssh command:
- ssh-inet my-server-without-internet
- ssh-inet user@my-server-without-internet
 
 Specific ssh-inet options are delimited with --:
- ssh-inet -v -- my-server-without-internet
- ssh-inet --help --

 TODO:
- 100x speed degradation vs 10x degradation over raw ssh -wN:N :( ;
  I don't know why the speed is so low because transmitting bits in test mode,
  --test_speed, the speed is even better vs -wN:N mode; one may test like so:
    cat /dev/urandom | pv | ssh-inet --test_speed -- 172.16.247.130
  ; details:
  - changing MTU and qlen is not working
  - it is better to measure speed (see 'pv') at the remote side
- the script requires "resolvconf" to exist on the remote side or it breaks;
  (it is used to add 8.8.8.8 nameserver)
- by default ssh-net copies yourself to the remote side and run as follows:
  ssh python3 - --remote_port 1080 --
  ; in such case the errors from remote side is not printed because it seems
  Python closes stdout/stderr after a shot time, too (not only stdin).
- the default route (to the internet) will be set up if there is no a default route
  there at the remote server
